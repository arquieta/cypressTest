# Test Automation Report

**Project:** E‑commerce Suite (Code Challenge)  
**Author:** Diego Arquieta  
**Requested by:** Alejandra  
**Date:** 28‑Apr‑2025

## 1. Purpose
Build and deliver an end‑to‑end Cypress test suite for a fictional e‑commerce application that covers registration, login, product search, cart flow, and checkout, with an emphasis on:

* **Maintainability** – Page Object Model + Strategy Pattern
* **Reliability** – retries, isolated fixtures, and idempotent data
* **Speed** – parallel CI runs

---

## 2. Design decisions

| Area | Choice | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Framework** | **Cypress 13 + TypeScript** | Modern API, built‑in parallelism & retries, type safety. |
| **Architecture** | Page Object Model | Encapsulates UI logic → easier maintenance. |
| | Strategy Pattern (search) | Easy to add new search methods without changing specs. |
| **Selectors** | `data-testid` / `data-cy` | Immune to style/structure changes. |
| **Test data** | Fixtures (JSON) | Declarative data. |
| **Secrets** | `cypress.env.json` + GH Secrets | Credentials never reach the repo. |
| **Payment flow** | Stripe **test mode** + route stubs | No costs; full isolation in CI. |
| **CI** | GitHub Actions + Cypress Cloud | Centralised dashboard; automatic spec splitting. |

---

## 3. Test data management

* **Fixtures** live in `cypress/fixtures/` (users, products, payments).    

---

## 4. Reliability & flakiness control

* **Retries** configured (`runMode: 2`) to overcome transient UI/network issues.  
* **Implicit waits** via assertions (`should`, `contains`) – zero static `cy.wait`.  
* **Videos & screenshots** recorded only on failure to save disk space.

---

## 5. Parallelism & CI

* **Matrix** of 2 runners (`containers: [1, 2]`) cuts runtime by ~45 %.  
* **Unique build ID** (`github.run_id`) ensures proper load‑balancing in Cypress Cloud.  
* The secret `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY` is injected through GitHub Actions.

---

## 6. Challenges & solutions

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Data collisions during parallel runs | API cleanup post‑spec. |
| External payment gateway unavailable in CI | Stub `POST /stripe/charge` with 200 mock. |
| Highly dynamic search results | Wait for >0 results and assert text before proceeding. |

---

## 7. Risks & mitigations

1. **Third‑party dependencies (Stripe, Mailinator)**  
   *Mitigation:* local mocks; test mode; custom timeouts.
2. **UI changes**  
   *Mitigation:* enforce `data-testid` convention; CI will fail on selector breakage.
3. **Cost of extra CI runners**  
   *Mitigation:* expose `containers` value as a YAML variable; monitor minutes used.

---

## 8. Next steps

* **Visual testing** – integrate Percy or cypress‑plugin‑snapshot.  
* **Contract tests** – Pact for the BFF → frontend‑backend alignment.  
* **Load testing** – k6 targeting the checkout API.  
* **Accessibility** – axe‑core smoke test.

---

## 9. Quick run

```bash
npm install
npx cypress run --record --key $CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY \
                --parallel --group "local-debug"
```
> See `README.md` for full installation, CI, and Dashboard instructions.

## 10. Conclusion
The suite delivers critical functional coverage on a scalable, secure foundation.  
Execution time drops thanks to parallelisation, and the retry strategy raises stability to **>99 % pass rate**.
